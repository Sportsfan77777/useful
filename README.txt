Useful scripts I have developed over the course of many random projects
that are useful in general

Usability varies.
Each script is scored from
1 = No one would ever use this, what does the code do
to
10 = Very well-documented, easy-to-use, and adaptable
In the long run, I want to perfect each script to a 10
